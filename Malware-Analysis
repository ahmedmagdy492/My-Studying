C and Low Level Programming:
the stack consists of 5 regions: an area for incoming parameters, space for a return value, temp storage for evaluating expression, saved state information for when the activation terminates, and outgoing parameters.

General Basic Concepts:
To Solve the problem of storing an address of a variable and then want to store the address of the address of that variable and so on and so fourth we can use a stack to do so:
-The top of the stack is point to by stack pointer register which stores the address of the next free slot

Networking:
Common methods to transfer data across the network:
1.Electerical Signals
2.Optical Signals
3.Wireless Signals

Bandwdith:
is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second for example 1 kilo bit per second, 1 mega bit per second

Throughput:
is like bandwidth describes the number of bits transferred over a physical media in a specified period (but with delays) but throughtput is not always the same as the bandwidth due to some factors:
-The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
-The types of data being transmitted
-The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

NOTE: one way to distinguish between bandwidth and throughput is to think about them in this way: 
bandwidth is how megabits could a physical media transfer per second theoritcally (does not take into account any factors) but on the other hand throughput is the actual rate of how mega bits per second could a specific piece of data take.

Network Connectivity Models:
-Client and Server: where one computer acts as a client and the other acts as a server
-Peer to Peer: here one computer can act as both

Network Infrastructure:
1.End Devices: laptops, desktops, smartphones, etc...
2.Intermediary Devices: Wireless Router, LAN Switch, Router, Firewall Appliance
3.Network Media: Wireless Media, Ethernet Media

Common Ways to connect a home or a small office network to the ISP:
-Cable:
Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television. A special cable modem separates the internet data signal from the other signals carried on the cable and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.

-DSL:
provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.
DSL runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels. One channel is used for voice telephone calls. This channel allows an individual to receive phone calls without disconnecting from the internet. A second channel is a faster download channel, used to receive information from the internet. The third channel is used for sending or uploading information. This channel is usually slightly slower than the download channel. The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and the distance from the central office of your phone company The farther you are from the central office, the slower the connection.


Other ISP connection options for home users include the following:
-Cellular
-Satalite
-Dial-up Telephone


Types of Wireless Networks:
-GPS: The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe. The smartphone can receive these signals and calculate the phone’s location to an accuracy of within 10 meters.

-Wi-Fi

-Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a low-power, shorter range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity for accessories such as speakers, headphones, and microphones. Bluetooth can also be used to connect a smartwatch to a smartphone. Because Bluetooth technology can be used to transmit both data and voice, it can be used to create small local networks. Bluetooth is wireless technology that allows devices to communicate over short distances. Multiple devices can be connected at the same time with Bluetooth.

-NFC: Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters. For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.

Wi-Fi Networks:
-if you want to make your wireless access point hidden you can disable SSID broadcasting
-Tethering - A mobile device can connect to another mobile device or computer to share a network connection. Tethering can also be performed with a Wi-Fi connection or a cable connection such as USB.

Bluetooth:
When a Bluetooth device is in discoverable mode, it transmits the following information when another Bluetooth device requests it:
-Name
-Bluetooth class
-Services that the device can use
-Technical information, such as the features or the Bluetooth specification that it supports


-Self Process Injection, Remote Process Injection: are techniques to execute shellcode in memory
-We can use unicorn to emulate generic shellcode that does not depened on any api calls because unicorn is not operating system aware, on the other hand we can use Qiling framework which is operating system aware and kind do a lot of the heavy lifting for us you just need to give it a start address and an end address
-We can use ghidra python binding to read and disassemble binary files and do some automated work with it

MALWARE ANALYSIS:
Host based Signatures:
it focuses on what the malware does rather than the characterstics of the malware, like what the antivirus does which makes them more effective in detecting malware that changes form or that has been deleted from the hard disk.

Network Signatures:
are used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic. Network signatures can be created without malware analysis, but signatures created with the help of malware analysis are usually far more effective, offering a higher detection rate and fewer false positives.

Malware analysis techniques:
-Basic Static Analysis 
-Basic Dynamic Analysis
-Advanced Static Analysis
-Advanced Dynamic Analysis

Basic Static analysis techniques:
-Using antivirus tools to confirm maliciousness
-Using hashes to identify malware
-Gleaning information from a file’s strings, functions, and headers

NOTE: hackers may try to attempt to hide the functionality of the malware by:
1.packing the executable
2.obfuscating the code

NOTE: obfuscated and packed malware will very often contain less strings

Types of Programs Linking:
-Static
-Runtime
-Dynamic

NOTE: Static linking is the least commonly used method of linking libraries, although it is common in UNIX and Linux programs.

While unpopular in friendly programs, runtime linking is commonly used in malware, especially when it’s packed or obfuscated. Executables that use runtime linking connect to libraries only when that function is needed, not at program start, as with dynamically linked programs.

VI NOTE: Several Microsoft Windows functions allow programmers to import linked functions not listed in a program’s file header.

Of all linking methods, dynamic linking is the most common and the most interesting for malware analysts. When libraries are dynamically linked, the host OS searches for the necessary libraries when the program is loaded. When the program calls the linked library function, that function executes within the library.

NOTE: in windows functions can be imported by oridinaly rather than the function names so that it mean if the attacker decided to link functions by its ordinal it makes the anyalist life harder to know which function is being linked and he has to lookup the function name by its oridinal.
