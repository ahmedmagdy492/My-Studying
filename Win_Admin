Environment Variables:
-$env:COMSPEC: contains the path of cmd

CMD:

what you will notice is that calc.exe has been executed.
-start <process-name>: starts a process

  start iexplore -> starts windows explorer
  another living off land binary execuation if you try to execute the following: 
  start iexplore shell:::{3f6bc534-dfa1-4ab4-ae54-ef25a74e0107}
  it will popup system restore if you have control over the environment variable "SYSTEMROOT" you can go ahead and execute what ever binary you want.
