    Determine the type of hook you need: There are several types of Windows hooks, including keyboard hooks, mouse hooks, and message hooks. In your case, you would need to use a message hook to intercept Send API calls.

    Create a hook function: A hook function is a callback function that is called by the system whenever the hook is triggered. In your hook function, you would need to intercept the Send API calls and perform any necessary processing.

    Install the hook: Once you have created your hook function, you need to install the hook using the SetWindowsHookEx function. This function registers your hook function with the system and specifies the type of hook you are using.

    Process the intercepted messages: Once your hook is installed, your hook function will be called whenever a Send API call is made. In your hook function, you can process the intercepted messages and perform any necessary actions.
