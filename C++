Initializer list:
- is used to initalize all types of member variables
- preferred way to initalize variables

Delegation:
in general the term delegation refers to moving work from me to another component to handle
it for me. in c++ an example of delegation is when a constructor delegates some work to
another constructor

Deleted Functions (since c++ 11):
You can declare an implicitly defined function as a deleted function if you
want to prevent its usage. For example, you can declare the implicitly
defined copy assignment operator and copy constructor of a class as deleted
functions to prevent object copy of that class.

Difference between shallow copy and deep copy:
shallow copy copies things in the 1st level of the object or in other words only copies
members that are actual members not pointers but on the other hand when it comes to pointers
the newly created pointer after copying is still pointing to the same original place in memory

deep copy on the other hand is copying the entire object including creating pointers that points
newly created piece of memory

Dangling pointer:
is a pointer that points to a memory that has already been deallocated

const keyword infront of a member function:
-the const here refers that this method will not change any member varaible, the reason why we should
use this const along with member functions as possible as we could to acheive data integrity

const keyword with objects:
if used when creating objects the object instance can only call member functions that are
marked as const (creates immutable objects)

friend class:
is a feature that allows a class to allow another class to access its private section

friend function:
the same idea of a friend class expect that only a function has access to the private seciton

static_cast<new_type>(variable): converts a type to a new type

manipulators:
are functions that changes the cout outputs
examples are: setbase(base_value) which sets the base field of the iostream directly to output the given number in a specific format such as hex or octal
