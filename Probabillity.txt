Probability:
Sample Space: is a set that has all the possiable outputs usually denoted as U or S (sometimes called the universe)
Event: is a subset of the sample space that represents an event
suppose U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and E is an event such that E = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
in this case E = U which means that the event is certain but in general
E <= U
NOTE: the imposiiable event is represented as follows:
E = {} or E = φ which represents an empty set
the bottom line is that we have 2 cases that are called extreme cases:
1.certain event
2.imposiable event
Operations on Event:
1.Intersection: A and B
2.Union: A or B
3.Complement: Not in A
Disjoint Events(Mutually Exclusive):
describes 2 events that can never occur at the same time
A Intersection B = φ or an empty set
Example: an event of getting an even and an odd number at the same time.

Propability:
P(A) -> means the propability of Event A to occur
Example:
P(A) = 0.8
there are 2 ways we can argue about this:
1.chance of occurance

2.relative frequency

NOTE: the more i increase the sample space the more accurate the propbaility will be
